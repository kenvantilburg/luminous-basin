Code repository for the paper **First Indirect Detection Constraints on a Solar Basin of Axions** by William DeRocco, Shalma Wegsman, Brian Grefenstette, Junwu Huang, and Ken Van Tilburg.

## Abstract

This is our abstract.

## Code

The [code](code/) folder contains various scripts and Jupyter notebooks that reproduce the plots in the paper (in [figures](figures/)), from where they are also linked. The code requires the python packages `numpy pandas tqdm scipy emcee corner matplotlib time`; a full list of requirements (including versions and dependencies) is found in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).
